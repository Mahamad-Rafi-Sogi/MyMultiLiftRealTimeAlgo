MyMultiLiftRealTimeAlgo is a Multi-Lift Real-Time Scheduling Algorithm

This project demonstrates a multi-lift scheduling system designed to efficiently handle elevator requests in real-time. It simulates a real-world scenario where multiple elevators operate in a building, responding dynamically to user inputs and optimizing operations.

Features:
	•	User-driven inputs for source and destination floors.
	•	Two elevators with dynamic scheduling based on proximity and current state.
	•	Real-time updates of elevator positions, directions, and pending requests.
	•	Intuitive console-based menu with options to add requests, step through operations, and display elevator status.

Key Concepts:
	•	Object-oriented programming in Java.
	•	Queue-based scheduling for elevator management.
	•	Real-time simulation and decision-making.

Use Case:
Ideal for understanding the basics of scheduling algorithms and their application in real-time systems such as building automation and multi-agent systems.
